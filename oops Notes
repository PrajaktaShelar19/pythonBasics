This programming paradigm is essential to understand and apply in various aspects of software development,

including testing.

In this lecture, we will discuss the core principles of Oop.

Its benefits in testing and gain a better understanding of why it is such a widely used programming

paradigm.

Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects that

represent real world entities.

Each object is an instance of the class which can have attributes and methods.

This organization makes it easier to model complex systems, manage dependencies and write reusable

code.

There are three key principles of Oop inheritance encapsulation and polymorphism.

Let's discuss each one in detail.

Inheritance allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

The class that inherits is called the subclass or derived class, while the class being inherited from

is called the base class or superclass.

Inheritance enables code, reuse and modularity, making it easier to maintain and expand your code

base.

Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data attributes and functions methods that operate on that

data within a single unit.

The class.

This approach helps to hide the implementation details from other parts of the code, making it easier

to modify and maintain the code.

Encapsulation also promotes data integrity by restricting direct access to an object's attributes.

Polymorphism is the ability of the function or method to work with different types of data or the ability

of different objects to respond to the same method call.

This principle allows you to write more flexible and reusable code by defining a single interface for

different classes and objects.

Now that we understand the key principles of Oop, let's discuss the benefits of object oriented programming

on the example of UI test automation.

Specifically when implementing the page object model, let's start with modularity.

Oop allows you to break down complex UI test automation tasks into manageable components such as individual

page objects, making it easier to organize and maintain your test code code reusability.

By using inheritance, you can create base page object for common UI elements and interactions.

Then extend these base classes for specific pages in your application.

This approach reduces code duplication and simplifies maintenance.

Next, flexibility polymorphism enables you to create a more adaptable UI test automation framework

that can handle different types of pages, elements and interactions without significant code changes.

This is particularly useful when dealing with dynamic web applications or when testing across multiple

platforms and browsers and maintainability encapsulation helps to create well-structured and self-contained

page objects that keep the implementation details of UI interactions hidden from the test cases.

This approach makes it easier to update and maintain your test suite when UI changes occur, as you

only need to modify the relevant page objects, not the test cases themselves.

In conclusion, object oriented programming is a powerful paradigm that can greatly benefit your test

automation efforts, especially when implementing the page object model by understanding and applying

the key principles of Oop inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism.

You.

You will be able to create more organized, reusable and maintainable code for your test automation

or other application.
